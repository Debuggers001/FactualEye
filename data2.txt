The news is **REAL**.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the statement in a speech on September 23, 2023, in response to a series of diplomatic measures taken by India against Canada in recent months. The measures include restrictions on Canadian diplomats in India, as well as increased scrutiny of Canadian visitors and students.

Trudeau said that India's actions are "making life hard for millions of people" and are "having a real impact on the millions of people who travel back and forth between India and Canada, as students and family members."

The diplomatic crisis between India and Canada began in February 2023, when the Indian government accused Canada of harboring separatists who are seeking to create an independent Sikh homeland in Punjab. Canada has denied the allegations, and the two countries have been engaged in a tense standoff ever since.

The situation has raised concerns about the future of the relationship between India and Canada, which is home to a large Indian diaspora. It has also raised questions about India's commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law.

While Trudeau is correct that India's actions are making life more difficult for some people, it is important to note that the diplomatic crisis is also having a negative impact on the relationship between the two countries as a whole. It is hoped that the two sides will be able to resolve their differences soon and get back to working together.
